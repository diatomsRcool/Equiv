# Equiv

This is the repo for the identifier equivalency tool needed for Data Commons Helium A1.M2.T1, but will likely be used in Monarch as well. 

## Assumptions

Users will search the commons for an attribute of a "data set". This tool will reconcile those results.
We are starting with TopMED, GTEx, and AGR.
All three of these data sets will be mapped to DATS.
