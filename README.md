# Equiv

This is the repo for the identifier equivalency tool needed for Data Commons Helium A1.M2.T1, but will likely be used in Monarch as well. 

## Assumptions

Users will search the commons for an attribute of a "data set". This tool will reconcile those results.

We are starting with TopMED, GTEx, and AGR.

All three of these data sets will be mapped to DATS.

TopMED: integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other â€“omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data.

GTEx: gene expressions in tissues

AGR: Go and model organism databases
